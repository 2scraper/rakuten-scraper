"""rakuten-scraper — pyppeteer edition

A parity engine. pyppeteer is effectively unmaintained and its own README
points at Playwright; this exists so the family has three drivers behind one
row schema, not because it is the better choice.

It must behave identically to `playwright_scraper.py`: the same flags, the
same rows in the same column order, the same exit codes and the same run
status. Verified on a live run against the same URL — see the README's
engine-parity table for the numbers and the date.

Three things about this site shape every engine here:

* **the rows come from `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`, not from the DOM.** All 45
  products of a listing page are in the first response, so there is no
  scroll and a readiness wait that times out costs the wait and nothing
  else;
* **never wait on `networkidle`.** Rakuten's ad and tracking beacons keep
  firing indefinitely, so that wait always runs to its timeout;
* **HTTP 503 is a throttle, not a block.** It is the site's own "access is
  concentrated" page and it wants a longer wait at the same exit, which is
  why `page_flow` gives it a separate budget from the block budget.

        # Note the third row, because it is what settles the cause: a UA
        # that agreed with the platform was refused just as hard. It is not
        # Windows-on-Linux, it is the override. Note also that nav 1 always
        # passes, which is why a one-page run of this engine looked fine and
        # a two-page run did not — and why this needed a live run rather
        # than a reading (§16).
        #
        # The cost of not overriding is that the UA says "HeadlessChrome".
        # On most sites that is a giveaway; on this one it is measured to be
        # served 4 times out of 4, while the disguise is measured to be
        # refused 3 times out of 4. Take the measurement over the instinct.

        # The likely mechanism, stated as the inference it is: pyppeteer
        # overrides through `Network.setUserAgentOverride` with no

        # User-Agent Client Hints (`Sec-CH-UA`, `navigator.userAgentData`)
        # keep reporting the real browser, and the page claims two clients
        # at once.
        #
        # But that explanation is NOT sufficient on its own, and the
        # counter-example is in this repo: `selenium_scraper.py` issues the
        # same `Network.setUserAgentOverride`, with the same absent
        # metadata, and was served 3 of 3 pages on a live run. So something
        # else about how pyppeteer drives the page is involved, and this
        # comment stops at the boundary of what was measured rather than
        # inventing the rest. If you find the real cause, the fix may be to
